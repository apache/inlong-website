## 发起社区 Private 邮件组投票讨论
任何 InLong 的 PMC 成员都可以发起投票讨论，PMC 在发现社区贡献者任何有价值的贡献并取得候选人本人同意后，可以在 InLong 的 Private 邮件列表发起讨论。
讨论邮件里提议者要把候选人的贡献阐述清楚，并且给出复核对应贡献的地址，便于大家讨论分析。
讨论邮件主送 private@inlong.apache.org 邮箱，讨论将持续至少 72 个小时，项目 PMC 成员会针对提议邮件充分发表自己的看法。
如下是讨论邮件模板：
```shell
[DISCUSS] ${Candidate_Full_Name} as an InLong ${Committer or PMC Member}
 
I nominate ${Candidate_Full_Name} as an InLong ${Committer or PMC Member}

Judging from the contributions in recent months, ${Candidate_Full_Name} has submitted many implementations[1],[2] to the project and improved the ${Candidate_Module_Name} module for the project. During the optimization and improvement period of the project, it is hoped that more people will participate in the actual project optimization and improvement, to let the project more perfect and easier to use.
 
So I nominated ${Candidate_Full_Name} as a ${Committer or PMC Member} of the InLong project.
 
1. https://github.com/apache/inlong/issues/created_by/${Candidate_GitHub_ID} 
2. https://github.com/apache/inlong/commits?author=${Candidate_GitHub_ID}
```

:::caution
可以向候选人提前沟通获得其全名（Full_Name），替换模板中的 `${Candidate_Full_Name}`。
:::

## 发起社区 Private 邮件组投票
如果讨论邮件在规定时间内没有收到分歧信息，投票发起者需要在 InLong 的 Private 邮件列表发起 Committer 或 PMC 成员的选举投票。
投票邮件主送 private@inlong.apache.org，至少持续 72 小时，至少要 3 票 +1 通过；如果 0 票或者有 1 票 -1 投票票则整个投票失败；如果发起 -1 投票，投票人需要把打分 -1 的原因说清楚，便于大家理解和知晓。
如下是投票邮件模板：
```shell
[VOTE] ${Candidate_Full_Name} as an InLong ${Committer or PMC Member}
 
Judging from the contributions in recent months, ${Candidate_Full_Name} has submitted many implementations[1],[2],[3] to the project and improved the ${Candidate_Module_Name} module for the project. During the optimization and improvement period of the project, it is hoped that more people will participate in the actual project optimization and improvement, to let the project more perfect and easier to use.
I think making him a ${Committer or PMC Member} will be a recognition of his outstanding work for InLong. So, I am happy to call VOTE to accept ${Candidate_Full_Name} as an InLong ${Committer or PMC Member}.
 
Voting will continue for at least 72 hours or until the required number of votes is reached.

Please vote accordingly:
[ ] +1 approve
[ ] +0 no opinion
[ ] -1 disapprove with the reason  
  
Here are three links to his contributions to InLong:
1. Issues: https://github.com/apache/inlong/issues/created_by/${Candidate_GitHub_ID}
2. PRs   : https://github.com/apache/inlong/pulls/created_by/${Candidate_GitHub_ID}
3. Others:  https://xxx.com/xxx/xxx/?q=${Candidate_GitHub_ID}
```

## 投票结果反馈
投票邮件结束后，投票发起者需要在上一封 [VOTE] 邮件里`提醒投票结束`；同时，投票发起者需要发起邮票总结邮件，总结邮件主送 private@inlong.apache.org。
如下是投票总结邮件模板：
```shell
[RESULTS][VOTE] ${Candidate_Full_Name} as an InLong ${Committer or PMC Member}

Hi everyone,

The vote for "${Candidate_Full_Name} as an InLong ${Committer or PMC Member}" has PASSED and closed now.

The result is as follows:

3 PMC Member +1 Votes
- ${the name 1 of PMC Member}
- ${the name 2 of PMC Member}
- ${the name 3 of PMC Member}

Vote thread:
${vote_thread_url}

Then I'm going to invite ${Candidate_Full_Name} to join us.

Thanks for everyone's support!   
```

:::caution
如果是未通过，结果是 "The vote for "${Candidate_Full_Name} as an InLong ${Committer or PMC Member}" has FAILED and closed now."

## 发起邀请邮件
投票总结邮件发出后，或者 PMC 成员选举的周知邮件到期后，投票发起人要给候选人发送邀请邮件。
邀请邮件主送被邀请人，抄送 private@inlong.apache.org；被邀请的候选人必须通过指定的邮箱地址回复接受或者拒绝该邀请。
如下是邀请候选人邮件模板：
```shell
[Invitation] Invitation to join Apache InLong as a ${Committer or PMC Member}

In recognition of your contributions to Apache InLong, the InLong PMC
has recently voted to add you as a ${Committer or PMC Member}. The a ${Committer or PMC Member} role gives

stepping-stone towards membership in the
Project Management Committee (PMC). We hope that you accept
this invitation and continue to help us make Apache InLong better.

The Apache InLong PMC
```

:::note
在签署 ICLA 时，候选人需要在 “notify project:” 栏目写上 Apache InLong 项目名，这样候选人帐号才会被 Apache 正确的加入对应项目人员名单。
:::

## 接受邀请后处理
候选人在邀请邮件下回复愿意接受邀请，创建 Apache 帐号。
投票发起人在[Whimsy Roster 工具](https://whimsy.apache.org/roster/committee/inlong)中将候选人帐号加入项目。

候选人接受邀请后，如果候选人没有 Apache 邮箱帐号，投票发起人需要协助候选人按照指引创建好 Apache 帐号，确认候选人的 Apache 帐号已加入 [Apache InLong](http://people.apache.org/phonebook.html?project=inlong) 项目。

## 订阅 Apache InLong 邮件组
PMC 候选人通过[Whimsy 邮件列表订阅工具](https://whimsy.apache.org/committers/subscribe.cgi)订阅 private@inlong.apache.org 邮件组

Committer 候选人无需该操作。

## 向社区发布申明邮件
如上步骤都完成后，投票发起人向 dev@inlong.apache.org 邮件组发通知邮件。
如下是通知邮件模板：
```shell
[ANNOUNCE] New a ${Committer or PMC Member}: ${Candidate_Full_Name}
