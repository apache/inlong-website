Key enhancements include:\\n\\n- **Agent**: Improved stability in data collection and resource management capabilities\\n- **SDK**: Multi-language support and performance optimizations\\n- **Sort**: Enhanced traffic control capabilities\\n\\nThis version also optimizes the operational and maintenance experience for Apache InLong. Other significant features are detailed below.\\n\\n### Dashboard Module\\n- Fixed page refresh issues after switching\\n- Optimized user login verification logic\\n\\n### Manager Module\\n- Added support for SQL data sources\\n- Enhanced JDBC validation\\n- Enabled configuration of Inlong Properties metadata for Pulsar data sources\\n\\n### Agent Module\\n- Optimized instance lifecycle control mechanism\\n- Introduced global instance count limits\\n- Fixed duplicate file collection issues\\n- Enhanced recovery capabilities in exceptional scenarios\\n- Improved accuracy in log collection\\n\\n### Sort Module\\n- Introduced traffic control for SortStandalone\\n- Optimized escaping processing for KV/CSV formats\\n- Added Exactly Once audit reporting for MySQL CDC\\n\\n### SDK Module\\n- Go SDK: Added connection pool lifetime limits to improve stability in high-concurrency scenarios\\n- Optimized JAVA SDK implementations\\n- SortSDK: Shared a single PulsarClient across SortTasks to avoid performance bottlenecks from excessive clients\\n\\n### Audit Module\\n- Supported CDC auditing for MySQL Binlog\\n\\n### TubeMQ Module\\n- Fixed intermittent consumption interruption issues\\n- Saved consumption offsets to local files\\n\\n## Key Features of Version 2.2.0\\n\\n### DataProxy SDK Refactoring\\nThe original SDK provided two separate Sender objects for TCP and HTTP reporting protocols, with independent logic and high maintenance costs. Error returns were coarse-grained without detailed error categorization.\\n\\nThis version reconstructs the DataProxy Java SDK to reduce user complexity:\\n- **Decoupled Sender construction and initialization**: Heavy operations (e.g., thread pool initialization, metadata fetching) are moved from the constructor to a new `start()` method, allowing faster object creation and explicit startup control.\\n- **TCP reporting with QoS**: Three modes are introduced:\\n    - *QoS 0*: SDK sends continuously without awaiting responses; DataProxy forwards requests silently.![2.2.0-sdk-qos0](img/2.2.0/2.2.0-sdk-qos0.png)\\n    - *QoS 1*: SDK awaits DataProxy acknowledgment before DataProxy forwards to MQ. ![2.2.0-sdk-qos1](img/2.2.0/2.2.0-sdk-qos1.png)\\n    - *QoS 2*: SDK awaits MQ-level confirmation from DataProxy ![2.2.0-sdk-qos2](img/2.2.0/2.2.0-sdk-qos2.png)\\n\\n  *Contributed by [@gosonzhang](https://github.com/gosonzhang) via [INLONG-11729](https://github.com/apache/inlong/pull/11730) and [INLONG-11720](https://github.com/apache/inlong/pull/11721)*.\\n\\n### Enhanced Agent Stability and Resource Management\\nAgent now enforces a global instance limit (default: 100, configurable via `agent.instance.limit`). Requests to add tasks are rejected if they exceed this limit, preventing resource exhaustion.\\n\\n![2.2.0-agent-global-control](img/2.2.0/2.2.0-agent-global-control.png)\\n\\n*Contributed by [@justinwwhuang](https://github.com/justinwwhuang) via [INLONG-11760](https://github.com/apache/inlong/issues/11760) and [INLONG-11776](https://github.com/apache/inlong/issues/11776)*.\\n\\n### Sort Traffic Control Enhancements\\nPreviously, SortStandalone allocated up to 1/3 of resources to new tasks, leading to idle resource waste. Version 2.2.0 introduces:\\n- **Lazy-loaded Flow Controller**: Physical resources are allocated only when a task\'s data stream is consumed. ![2.2.0-sort-resource-assign-1](img/2.2.0/2.2.0-sort-resource-assign-1.png)\\n- **Dynamic resource allocation**: Resources scale based on actual traffic demand. ![2.2.0-sort-resource-assign-2](img/2.2.0/2.2.0-sort-resource-assign-2.png)\\n- **Failure handling**: Blocks data flow for high-failure-rate tasks to prevent systemic degradation. ![2.2.0-sort-resource-assign-3](img/2.2.0/2.2.0-sort-resource-assign-3.png)\\n\\n*Contributed by [@luchunliang](https://github.com/luchunliang) via [INLONG-11836](https://github.com/apache/inlong/issues/11836) and [INLONG-11841](https://github.com/apache/inlong/issues/11841)*.\\n\\n## Future Plans\\nIn version 2.1.0, we have enriched and improved our operational capabilities.

Therefore, after version 1.13.0, a very important task for the InLong community\\nwas to enhance support for Transform capabilities, allowing users to perform more flexible processing of data at any stage of data integration.\\n\\nTransform is based on general SQL semantics and has now completed the framework for Transform capabilities, supporting over 180 custom Transform functions \\nwhile ensuring the extensibility of Transform from a design perspective, allowing users to flexibly define new Transform capabilities.\\n\\nIn addition to the Transform feature, another focus of the InLong community has been the restructuring of community documentation. \\nOn one hand, we have filled in missing documentation and updated outdated content; \\non the other hand, we have reorganized the documentation according to user guidance, core system introduction, development guidance, and system management,\\nproviding better explanations from user, developer, and operational perspectives. With the restructured documentation,\\nusers can more easily utilize InLong and better understand its operational and management mechanisms, \\nas well as quickly develop custom plugins to meet specific needs.\\n\\nOverall, by the time version 2.0.0 was released:\\n- InLong has achieved full-link support for offline synchronization tasks, possessing stream-batch integrated data processing capabilities.\\n- InLong has greatly enriched the capabilities of T, laying the foundation for future support of ELT/EtLT Pipelines.\\n- The optimization of documentation has made InLong more user-friendly, better attracting users to understand, use, and co-build InLong.\\n\\nInLong now supports both standard and lightweight architectures, stream-batch integrated data synchronization capabilities, and flexible data Transform capabilities. Therefore, the community has decided to upgrade InLong to version 2.0.0, marking the official entry of Apache InLong into the 2.0 era.\\n\\n\\n## 2.0.0 Overview\\nApache InLong has recently released

expand access and distribution capabilities by adapting to a wider range of data protocols and reporting scenarios on the input side,\\nwhile accommodating complex and diverse data analysis scenarios on the output side. This improves data quality and collaboration, providing computing capabilities such as connection, \\naggregation, filtering, grouping, value extraction, and sampling, all decoupled from the computation engine.\\n\\nIt simplifies the pre-processing operations for users reporting data, lowers the barriers to data usage, and streamlines the pre-operations required before users can start analyzing data. \\nThe focus is on the business value of data, achieving the goal of making data \\"visible and usable.\\"\\n\\n![2.0.0-transform-background.png](img/2.0.0/2.0.0-transform-background.png)\\n\\nTransform has a wide range of application scenarios.

InLong version 2.0.0 adds support for OceanBase data sources, allowing data to be imported from data sources into OceanBase.\\n\\nManaging OceanBase data nodes is similar to MySQL. To create a new OceanBase node, you need to fill in the node name, type (OceanBase), username, password, address, and other key information.\\n\\n![2.0.0-oceanbase-detail.png](img/2.0.0/2.0.0-oceanbase-detail.png)\\n\\nTo write data into OceanBase, you first need to create a data target of type `OceanBase`.\\n\\n![2.0.0-oceanbase-type.png](img/2.0.0/2.0.0-oceanbase-type.png)\\n\\nThen fill in the relevant information, including the name, data node information, database and table names of the data target, and the primary key information of the target table.\\n\\n![2.0.0-oceanbase-target.png](img/2.0.0/2.0.0-oceanbase-target.png)\\n\\nThanks to @xxsc0529 for their contributions to this feature. For more details, please refer to [INLONG-10700](https://github.com/apache/inlong/pull/10700), [INLONG-10701](https://github.com/apache/inlong/pull/10701), [INLONG-10704](https://github.com/apache/inlong/pull/10704).\\n\\n### Dynamic Resource Calculation for Sort Tasks\\nThe total resources (task parallelism) for Flink Sort Jobs come from the configuration file `flink-sort-plugin.properties`, meaning that all submitted sorting jobs will use the same amount of resources. When the data scale is large, resources may be insufficient, and when the data scale is small, resources may be wasted.\\n\\nTherefore, dynamically calculating the required resource quantity based on data volume is a much-needed feature. InLong now supports dynamically calculating the total resource requirements for tasks based on data volume, involving two core pieces of data:\\n\\n- The data volume of the task: This relies on the audit system and is derived from the average data volume recorded by `DataProxy` over the past hour.\\n- The processing capacity per core: This depends on the maximum number of messages per core configured in the `flink-sort-plugin.properties` file.\\n\\nWith these two pieces of data, the total resource requirements for a task can be calculated. This feature supports a switch to enable or disable it as needed.\\n\\nThanks to @PeterZh6 for their contributions to this feature. For more details, please refer to [INLONG-10916](https://github.com/apache/inlong/pull/10916).\\n\\n### SortStandalone Supports HTTP Sink\\nInlong SortStandalone is responsible for consuming data from MQ and distributing it to various data storage modules, supporting multiple data stores such as ElasticSearch and CLS.\\n\\nCompared to SortFlink, SortStandalone offers higher performance and lower latency, making it suitable for scenarios with high performance requirements.\\n\\nHTTP is a widely used communication protocol, and SortStandalone supports HTTP output, allowing data to be sent to HTTP interfaces without worrying about specific storage implementations, thus adapting more flexibly to different business scenarios.\\n\\nThe processing flow for HTTP output is as follows:\\n\\n![2.0.0-sortstandalone-http.png](img/2.0.0/2.0.0-sortstandalone-http.png)\\n\\nHTTP output has the following features:\\n\\n- SortSDK is responsible for consuming data from MQ\\n- Supports semaphore-based traffic control capabilities\\n- Metadata management relies on Manager, supporting dynamic updates\\n- The output protocol is HTTP, decoupling specific storage implementations\\n- Supports retry strategies\\n\\nThanks to @yfsn666 and @fuweng11 for their contributions to this feature. For more details, please refer to [INLONG-10831](https://github.com/apache/inlong/pull/10831) and [INLONG-10884](https://github.com/apache/inlong/pull/10884).\\n\\n### Full-Link Management of Offline Synchronization\\n\\nVersion 2.0.0 adds full-link management capabilities for offline data synchronization tasks, with configuration methods for offline synchronization tasks similar to real-time synchronization. The specific process is as follows:\\n\\nFirst, create the Group information for the synchronization task.\\n\\n![2.0.0-offline-sync-group.png](img/2.0.0/2.0.0-offline-sync-group.png)\\n\\nNote that the \\"Sync Type\\" should be selected as \\"Offline.\\"\\n\\nThe second step is to configure the scheduling information for the offline task.\\n\\n![2.0.0-offline-schedule-common.png](img/2.0.0/2.0.0-offline-schedule-common.png)\\n\\nThe conventional scheduling configuration requires setting the following parameters:\\n- Scheduling unit: Supports minute, hour, day, month, year, and single execution (single execution means it will only run once)\\n- Scheduling cycle: Represents the time interval between two task schedules\\n- Delay time: Represents the delay time for task startup\\n- Valid time: Includes start and end times; scheduled tasks will only run within this time range\\n\\nIn addition to conventional scheduling methods, Crontab configuration is also supported.\\n\\n![2.0.0-offline-schedule-crontab.png](img/2.0.0/2.0.0-offline-schedule-crontab.png)\\n\\nCrontab scheduling requires setting the following parameters:\\n- Valid time: Includes start and end times; scheduled tasks will only run within this time range\\n- Crontab expression: Represents the task cycle, for example, `0 */5 * * * ?`\\n\\nThe third step is to create a Stream and configure data source and target information, which is consistent with real-time synchronization and will not be repeated here. \\nFor more details, please refer to [Offline Synchronization Pulsar->MySQL](https://inlong.apache.org/docs/next/quick_start/offline_data_sync/pulsar_mysql_example).\\n\\n## Summary and Future Plans\\nVersion 2.0.0 is the first version of the 2.x series, and the technical capability framework has been basically established. We welcome everyone to use it.\\nIf you have more scenarios and requirements, or encounter issues during use, please feel free to raise issues and PRs.\\nIn future versions, the InLong community will continue to:\\n- Support more data source collection capabilities.\\n- Enrich Flink 1.15 and 1.18 connectors.\\n- Continuously enhance Transform capabilities.\\n- Provide real-time synchronization support for more data sources and targets.\\n- Advance offline integration, supporting third-party scheduling engines.\\n- Optimize SDK capabilities and user experience.\\n- Improve Dashboard experience.\\n\\nWe also look forward to more developers interested in InLong to contribute and help drive the project\'s development!"},{"id":"/2024/07/18/release-1.13.0","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/07/18/release-1.13.0","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/inlong-website/edit/master/blog/blog/2024-07-18-release-1.13.0.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-07-18-release-1.13.0.md","title":"Release 1.13.0","description":"Apache InLong recently released version 1.13.0, which closed about 275+ issues, including 6+ major features and 100+ optimizations.

Users can create a new Agent cluster on the cluster management page.\\n\\n![1.13.0-agent-cluster.png](img/1.13.0/1.13.0-agent-cluster.png)\\n\\nAfterwards, enter the node, select the new node, and configure the SSH username and password to achieve SSH installation agent capability. \\nThanks to @haifxu and @fuweng11. For more information, please refer to INLONG-10409.\\n\\n![1.13.0-agent-install.png](img/1.13.0/1.13.0-agent-install.png)\\n\\n### Manager supports field template management\\nWith this feature, users can pre-configure field templates, and when creating a new Stream, they can select the pre-configured field templates, thus achieving the purpose of reusing configurations across multiple Streams.\\nThanks to @kamianlaida and @fuweng11. For more information, please refer to: INLONG-10330.\\n\\n![1.13.0-create-template.png](img/1.13.0/1.13.0-create-template.png)\\n\\n### Support the construction of the underlying framework for configuring offline synchronization tasks\\nIn version 1.13.0, Manager supports the configuration of offline synchronization tasks. Compared to real-time synchronization, offline data synchronization pays more attention to synchronization throughput and efficiency.\\nReal-time synchronization tasks run in the manner of Flink stream tasks, while offline synchronization runs in the manner of Flink batch tasks. This approach can ensure the consistency of real-time and offline synchronization tasks\' code as much as possible, reducing maintenance costs.\\nThe offline synchronization function of InLong will be combined with the scheduling system to synchronize the complete or incremental data of the data source information to the data target. The offline synchronization task is created by InLong Manager (including scheduling information), and the specific data synchronization logic is implemented through the InLong Sort module.\\n\\n![1.13.0-offline-architecture.png](img/1.13.0/1.13.0-offline-architecture.png)\\n\\nKey Competency:\\n- Job Type: Support single or periodic offline data synchronization.\\n- Scheduling:The scheduling function is plugin based, with a built-in simple periodic scheduling function that allows customization of third-party scheduling systems to support more complex capabilities, such as task dependencies.\\n- Compute Engine: Flink\\n- Offline Job Operation and Maintenance: Job start,stop and running status monitoring\\n- Special Handling: Dirty Data Processing Capability\\n\\nThe following is the core process:\\n\\n![1.13.0-dataflow-architecture.png](img/1.13.0/1.13.0-dataflow-architecture.png)\\n\\nThanks to @aloyszhang. For more information, please refer to: INLONG-10054, INLONG-10053, INLONG-10055, INLONG-10069.\\n\\n### Optimize the Sort Standalone configuration process\\nIn version 1.13.0, the distribution process of Sort Standalone configuration was modified. In previous versions, there were the following issues with the distribution of Sort Standalone configuration:\\n- Configuration changes are unreliable. Configuration changes will be updated in real-time to the manager\'s cache. Once the configuration is changed, Sort Standalone will sense it and write data based on the new configuration without verifying the configuration.\\n- The configuration and construction process is repetitive and cumbersome. When pulling the Sort configuration from the database, it is a full pull and real-time build is performed after the pull is complete.\\n\\nIn the new version, after modifying the data target, the Sort configuration will not take effect in real time, but will need to be built and written into the sort_config table after executing the workflow. The following figure shows a process comparison:\\n\\n![1.13.0-manager-standalone.png](img/1.13.0/1.13.0-manager-standalone.png)\\n\\nThanks to @fuweng11, @vernedeng. For more information, please refer to: INLONG-9867, INLONG-10017.\\n\\n### Agent ability for collecting data from PostgreSQL\\nIn version 1.13.0, Agent supports data collection from PostgreSQL. When creating a data source, you can directly select PostgreSQL and fill all relevant data source information to start using it. The parameters include:\\n- Data source name: Used to distinguish between different data sources\\n- Cluster name: The cluster of data source belongs\\n- Data source IP: The IP information of data source\\n- Server Host: PostgreSQL Server Host \\n- Port: PostgreSQL port\\n\\nThanks to @haifxu. For more information, please refer to: INLONG-10318.\\n\\n![1.13.0-agent-postgreSQL.png](img/1.13.0/1.13.0-agent-postgreSQL.png)\\n\\n### Sort connectors reporting audit information supports exactly once\\nSort Connectors support for exactly once semantics in reporting audit information.\\nWhen an operator encounters an exception and the snapshot fails, each Connector ensures that the audit information is reported exactly once.\\nAs shown in the following diagram, when data is transferred, the current data will be written to the current operator\'s AuditBuffer and the corresponding checkpointId. When the checkpoint is completed (within the notifyCompleteCheckpoint method), the data written to the buffer will be reported.\\n\\n![1.13.0-sort-exactly.png](img/1.13.0/1.13.0-sort-exactly.png)\\n\\nDuring the execution of snapShot, the checkpointId written to the buffer will be changed to the checkpointId in the snapShot, and when the checkpoint is completed,\\nthe audit information corresponding to the checkpointId will be uploaded to the Audit Server within the notifyCompleteCheckpoint method. In the Audit SDK,\\nit is already supportedto report all information in the Audit buffer that is less than the specified checkpointId.\\n\\n![1.13.0-sort-audit.png](img/1.13.0/1.13.0-sort-audit.png)\\n\\nThanks to @XiaoYou201. For more information, please refer to: INLONG-10311, INLONG-10312, INLONG-10317, INLONG-10355, INLONG-10357, INLONG-10358, INLONG-10401.\\n\\n## Future plans\\nIn version 1.13.0, the community refactored the process of Manager issuing Agent, Sort tasks, enriched features such as Flink 1.15 Connector, Inlong Agent collecting PostgreSQL and other functions. In subsequent versions, InLong will continue to enrich Flink 1.15 Connector, enhance Transform capabilities, support offline data integration, unify DataProxy data protocols, optimize Dashboard experience, etc. We look forward to more developers participating and contributing."},{"id":"/2024/04/21/release-1.12.0","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/04/21/release-1.12.0","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/inlong-website/edit/master/blog/blog/2024-04-21-release-1.12.0.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-04-21-release-1.12.0.md","title":"Release 1.12.0","description":"Apache InLong recently released version 1.12.0, which closed about 140+ issues, including 7+ major features and 90+ optimizations.

The periodic strategy includes daily, hourly, and real-time, and users can specify this strategy when creating a new file data source. At the same time, users can also configure time offsets to delay or advance collection. Thanks to @Justinhuang, @Blue\\n![1.10.0-periodic-collection.png](img/1.10.0/1.10.0-periodic-collection.png)\\n\\n### Support for viewing Agent audit by IP dimension\\nIn order to better monitor the status of InLong Agent and quickly discover problems in live network operation, in version 1.10.0, users can view different Agent audit indicators based on the IP dimension in the system operation and maintenance -> audit module. Thanks to @fuwen11, @Bluewang, and @Justinhuang for their contributions, for more details, please see INLONG-9443, INLONG-9446, and INLONG-9458.\\n![1.10.0-agent-audit.png](img/1.10.0/1.10.0-agent-audit.png)\\n\\n### Manager adds Group operation logs\\nIn version 1.10.0, InLong supports viewing operation logs, including the creation and modification of Group/Stream, and the addition and removal of Sink/Source operations. Operation logs can quickly help users track historical behavior, allowing users to quickly view key data stream operations for easier live network maintenance. Users can view all operation logs under a Group in the Data Access -> Group Details -> Operation Logs section.\\n![1.10.0-group-operation-log.png](img/1.10.0/1.10.0-group-operation-log.png)\\n\\n### New ability to switch Group clusters\\nIn order to support resource integration and cost allocation capabilities, InLong introduced the Group cluster switching feature in version 1.10.0. Direct switching will inevitably lead to problems such as unsynchronized metadata between modules and data loss. To achieve seamless cluster switching for businesses, Group cluster switching is divided into three states and two steps. Thanks to @Vernedeng for the contribution, for more details, please see INLONG-9314.\\n![1.10.0-group-switching-1.png](img/1.10.0/1.10.0-group-switching-1.png)\\nBefore switching clusters, the data is on Cluster 1.\\n![1.10.0-group-switching-2.png](img/1.10.0/1.10.0-group-switching-2.png)\\nAfter starting the cluster switch, the original routing configuration is copied, new data is written to Cluster 2, and the unsent data on Cluster 1 continues to be sent.\\n![1.10.0-group-switching-3.png](img/1.10.0/1.10.0-group-switching-3.png)\\n\\n### C++ SDK supports multi-dimensional isolation\\nIn the old version of the C++ SDK, all Groups competed for the internal resources of the SDK. If a particular Group has a particularly large flow, it will inevitably squeeze other Groups, causing small flow Groups to be unable to obtain resources. In version 1.10.0, DataProxy C++ SDK supports resource isolation at the Cluster and Group levels, and users can enable or disable it by configuring enable_isolation. Thanks to @doleyzi for the contribution, for more details, please see INLONG-9213.\\n![1.10.0-sdk-isolation.png](img/1.10.0/1.10.0-sdk-isolation.png)\\n\\n## Future plans\\nIn version 1.10.0, the community refactored InLong Agent, enriched Flink 1.15 Connector, and completed support for viewing operation logs and other functions. In subsequent versions, InLong will continue to enrich Flink 1.15 Connector, enhance Transform capabilities, unify DataProxy data protocols, support integration with Apache Paimon, optimize Dashboard experience, etc. We look forward to more developers participating and contributing."},{"id":"/2023/09/25/release-1.9.0","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/09/25/release-1.9.0","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/inlong-website/edit/master/blog/blog/2023-09-25-release-1.9.0.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-09-25-release-1.9.0.md","title":"Release 1.9.0","description":"Apache InLong recently released version 1.9.0, which closed about 200+ issues, including 2+ major features and 30+ optimizations.

The main work completed in this version includes building observability capabilities, optimizing DataProxy C++ SDK, optimizing DataProxy metadata configuration updates, adding command-line tools for TubeMQ, automatically switching write methods for Iceberg, and supporting resource migration between tenants in Manager. After the release of version 1.9.0, Apache InLong has enhanced its observability capabilities in areas such as end-to-end tracing, metric collection, access and visualization, and alerting. This addresses the need for rapid problem diagnosis and performance optimization during development and operations, while also improving the user experience for Apache InLong\'s operation and maintenance.\\n\\nIn addition, Apache InLong 1.9.0 includes a large number of other features, mainly including:\\n\\n### Agent module\\n\\n- Support end-to-end log tracking and reporting, enhancing observability capabilities\\n- Remove metric reporting deregistration logic during TaskManager initialization\\n- Remove capacity limit for setting blacklist\\n- Optimize Agent\'s JVM parameters\\n\\n### DataProxy module\\n\\n- Optimize metadata update logic\\n- Optimize DataProxy metric statistics\\n- Optimize retry logic after failed sending\\n\\n### Sort module\\n\\n- Data synchronization supports audit metric reporting\\n- Iceberg supports dynamic switching between append and upsert modes\\n- When writing data to Kafka, support writing to different partitions based on custom fields\\n- PostgreSQL supports multi-concurrent reading\\n- Doris write supports automatic Schema changes\\n\\n### Manager module\\n\\n- Support end-to-end log tracking and reporting, enhancing observability capabilities\\n- Support data targets such as Tencent CLS, Pulsar cluster, Iceberg, and StarRocks\\n- Support Iceberg and StarRocks as data sources on Flink 1.15\\n- Improve multi-tenant capabilities: including tenant status validation before deleting a tenant, OpenAPI support for tenant parameters, and multi-tenant configuration support for data sources\\n- ManagerClient supports paginated queries for data stream Source and Sink resources\\n\\n### Dashboard module\\n\\n- Support management of Pulsar data clusters and support output to Pulsar\\n- Optimize the performance of tenant permission queries\\n- Improve the usability of the interface display\\n\\n### Audit module\\n\\n- Add audit_tag information to distinguish between data sources and data targets\\n- Optimize audit Proxy log output\\n\\n### SDK module\\n\\n- Optimize DataProxySDK-CPP, improving performance and reliability during network instability\\n- SortSDK supports parallel creation of cache layer consumption\\n- Optimize failure retry strategy for DataProxySDK-Java\\n\\n### TubeMQ module\\n\\n- Add TubeMQ command-line tool\\n- TubeMQ Manager adds restart script\\n\\n### Others\\n\\n- Add ASF DOAP file\\n- Add Mysql connector management image\\n- Optimize third-party dependencies to address security risks\\n\\n## 1.9.0 Feature Introduction\\n\\n### Observability Capability Building\\n\\nIn the application process of Apache InLong, the following scenario requirements are often encountered:\\n\\n- Locate the problematic code through detailed link call data (Tracing)\\n- Query and analyze the abnormal module and associated logs to find the core error information (Logs)\\n- Open the monitoring dashboard to find abnormal phenomena and locate the abnormal module through queries (Metrics)\\n- Discover anomalies through various preset alarms (Metrics/Logs)\\n\\nIn version 1.9.0, @ZhaoNiuniu has contributed to the complete observability capability building of InLong based on OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry provides flexible, convenient, and rich Span customization capabilities, such as adding custom attributes, adding events, etc. By embedding points in the core positions of the code, the data can be displayed in the backend UI. The entire solution mainly includes the following steps:\\n\\n- The application pushes the Trace, Log, and Metric data collected through instrumentation to the otel collector using the otlp-exporter;\\n- The otel collector collects and converts the data, then exports it to Jaeger, Prometheus, and Elasticsearch;\\n- Grafana configures the three data sources for unified display, query, monitoring, and alerting.\\n\\n![1.9.0-observability.png](img/1.9.0/1.9.0-observability.png)\\n\\nThanks to @ZhaoNiuniu\'s contribution, see INLONG-8611 and INLONG-8799 for details.\\n\\n### Optimize DataProxy C++ SDK\\n\\nThe older version of DataProxy C++ SDK was developed based on the C language, which had limited extensibility. The use of the singleton pattern resulted in performance limitations, and the handling of failed sending scenarios was unreasonable, which could easily trigger coredump. Therefore, the SDK has been optimized with the following improvements:\\n\\n- Adopt the C++ development mode, refactor DataProxy C++ SDK, no longer limited by the C language, enhancing the extensibility of the code;\\n- A single process supports multiple SDK instances, allowing horizontal scaling by adding SDK instances, breaking through performance limitations;\\n- Decouple data reception and data transmission, allowing separate configuration of the number of threads for receiving and sending, improving the SDK\'s scalability;\\n- Decouple the SDK\'s data packaging logic from the business thread, reducing the impact on the business thread while improving the packaging performance;\\n- Resolve the issue of the older version SDK causing coredump due to sending failures from the root.\\n\\nWith these optimizations, the DataProxy C++ SDK becomes more efficient, scalable, and reliable, providing better data processing capabilities for Apache InLong users.\\n\\n![1.9.0-dataproxycplussdk.png](img/1.9.0/1.9.0-dataproxycplussdk.png)\\n\\nThanks to @doleyzi\'s contribution, see INLONG-8747 for details.\\n\\n### Optimize metadata update logic of DataProxy\\n\\nDataProxy fetches metadata configuration from Manager, but sometimes due to network issues, misoperations, or other reasons, DataProxy may obtain incorrect metadata configuration from Manager. In version 1.9.0, DataProxy has added a protection mechanism for metadata configuration updates, enhancing the reliability of Apache InLong in extreme scenarios. The logic of the metadata configuration update protection mechanism is as follows:\\n\\n- When DataProxy receives a new metadata configuration from Manager, it first checks the configuration\'s validity, such as checking for null values, incorrect formats, etc., to ensure that the received configuration is correct and complete.\\n- DataProxy compares the new configuration with the current configuration. If there are no significant differences, it ignores the new configuration and continues using the current one. This helps avoid unnecessary updates and reduces the impact on the system.\\n- If the new configuration has significant differences from the current configuration, DataProxy will update its internal data structures and processing logic accordingly, ensuring that the system can adapt to the new configuration without causing errors or data loss.\\n- In case the new configuration causes errors or issues, DataProxy will roll back to the previous configuration and report the problem to Manager, allowing the system to maintain its stability and reliability.\\n\\nBy implementing this protection mechanism for metadata configuration updates, Apache InLong can better handle extreme scenarios and ensure the reliability of its data processing capabilities.\\n\\n![1.9.0-dataproxymetadataupdate.png](img/1.9.0/1.9.0-dataproxymetadataupdate.png)\\n\\nThanks to @gosonzhang\'s contribution, see INLONG-8758 and INLONG-8899 for details.\\n\\n### TubeMQ command-line tool\\n\\nTo enable Apache InLong operations and maintenance personnel to perform various operations simply, quickly, and flexibly in terminal windows in server management and DevOps scenarios, TubeMQ provides command-line tools to manage topics, produce and consume messages, and manage consumer groups through command-line parameters or options. For detailed usage documentation, please refer to [TubeMQ Command-line Tools](https://inlong.apache.org/docs/modules/tubemq/commandline_tools/). The main features include:\\n\\n- Managing topics: creating, deleting, and querying topics, as well as setting topic attributes such as the number of partitions and replication factor.\\n- Producing messages: sending messages to specified topics, with support for custom message content, key, and partition.\\n- Consuming messages: consuming messages from specified topics and partitions, with support for specifying consumer groups and offsets.\\n- Managing consumer groups: creating, deleting, and querying consumer groups, as well as setting consumer group attributes such as rebalancing and offset management.\\n- Monitoring and statistics: collecting and displaying various statistics and metrics related to topics, producers, consumers, and consumer groups, helping users understand the system\'s performance and status.\\n\\nBy providing these command-line tools, Apache InLong allows operations and maintenance personnel to manage and operate TubeMQ more easily and efficiently in various scenarios.\\n\\n```\\n$ bin/tubectl [options] [command] [command options]\\n$ bin/tubectl topic -h\\n$ bin/tubectl message produce\\n$ bin/tubectl message consume\\n$ bin/tubectl cgroup list\\n```\\n\\nThanks to @fancycoderzf\'s contribution, see INLONG-4972 for details.\\n\\n### Automatically switch write modes of Iceberg\\n\\nCurrently, the real-time synchronization from MySQL to Iceberg uses the upsert mode by default during the full data phase. The upsert implementation in Iceberg involves a delete operation followed by an add operation, with the delete operation resulting in the creation of a large number of delete files. This significantly impacts query efficiency. This optimization enables the task to use Append mode during the full data phase and automatically switch to Upsert mode during the incremental phase. The implementation involves the source carrying metadata fields in the data to determine which write mode to use in the Iceberg writer. When switching write modes, the data is refreshed, and the metadata fields are removed during the actual write operation.\\n\\n![1.9.0-icebergswitch.png](img/1.9.0/1.9.0-icebergswitch.png)\\n\\nThanks to [@lordcheng10](https://github.com/lordcheng10) and @Emsnap\'s contribution.\\n\\n### Manager support resource migration between tenants\\n\\nAfter InLong supports multi-tenancy, InLong Groups upgraded from older versions will be defined under the public tenant, while newly created InLong Groups will be defined within the tenant under the user\'s name. This leads to users frequently switching between multiple tenants to use resources. This optimization supports the migration of InLong Groups between different tenants, while also validating and automatically creating corresponding cluster labels, data nodes, and other resources.\\n\\n![1.9.0-managertenant.png](img/1.9.0/1.9.0-managertenant.png)\\n\\nThanks to @vernedeng\'s contribution.\\n\\n## Follow-up planning\\n\\nIn the 1.9.0 version, the community has also refactored the DataProxy C++ SDK, enriched the Flink 1.15 Connector, and improved data synchronization features. In subsequent versions, InLong will continue to enrich the Flink 1.15 Connector, enhance the scheduling capabilities of data synchronization, and improve the Agent\'s file collection capabilities.

Apache InLong has built a comprehensive data integration solution, achieving out-of-the-box usability:\\n\\n- Data access: Data access is the process of aggregating data from data sources to the same storage service for further data querying and analysis;\\n- Data synchronization: Data synchronization is the process of establishing consistency between data sources and target data storage, which can coordinate data over time;\\n- Data subscription: Data subscription provides subscribers with the data they are authorized to access;\\n\\nIn version 1.8.0 of Apache InLong, many other features have also been completed, mainly including:\\n\\n### Agent module\\n- Optimized ultra-long log processing logic, improving file collection efficiency and stability\\n- Fixed the issue of thread leakage caused by task termination\\n- Adopted flow control to solve the OOM problem caused by file number growth\\n\\n### DataProxy module\\n- Support for Golang SDK\\n- Support for configuring black and white lists based on full IP or CIDR format IP segments\\n- Support for configuring the maximum number of write retries\\n- Support for sending data to the default Topic when write fails\\n- Code refactoring, unified configuration acquisition method\\n\\n### Sort module\\n- Enhanced DDL parsing capability, improving the stability of DDL-aware scenarios\\n- Support for multiple Flink versions\\n- Support for Decimal precision recognition in whole-library scenarios\\n- Hive supports whole-library migration, with the implementation consistent with MySQL whole-library migration\\n- Iceberg supports automatic column updates and column deletions, greatly enriching Schema change capabilities\\n\\n### Manager module\\n- Support for Pulsar, TubeMQ data preview\\n- Support for dynamic configuration of audit data sources\\n- Support for querying audit delay information\\n- Support for multi-tenant management\\n\\n### Dashboard module\\n- Support for data flow preview\\n- Support for viewing InLongGroup resource details\\n- Support for tenant management and tenant switching\\n- Support for data synchronization\\n\\n### Others\\n- Remove conflicting Jsqlparser versions\\n- Upgrade Spring-Boot-Autoconfigure version to 2.6.15\\n- Upgrade the Snappy-Java version to 1.1.10.1\\n- Fix syntax errors in Workflow configuration files\\n\\n## 1.8.0 Feature Introduction\\n### Agent optimizes ultra-long log processing logic, improving file collection efficiency and stability\\nIn actual use, due to improper use by users or bugs in data production programs, occasionally, a single data length reaches MB or even GB level. For Agents deployed in low-profile environments, this type of data greatly affects the performance of sending. The lower version Agent reads this type of data directly into memory based on the newline character and then discards it, but is limited by the hardware configuration of the Agent deployment environment, a single ultra-long data is extremely likely to cause OOM exceptions. In version 1.8.0, Agent optimized the processing logic of ultra-long logs, ensuring that data loading does not exceed memory limits through segmented collection and segmented discarding. Thanks to @justinhuang\'s contribution, see INLONG-8180 for details.\\n![1.8.0-agent-under-1.8.0.png](img/1.8.0/1.8.0-agent-under-1.8.0.png)\\n![1.8.0-agent-1.8.0.png](img/1.8.0/1.8.0-agent-1.8.0.png)\\n\\n### Agent adopts global flow control, solving the OOM problem caused by the growth of file numbers\\nIn previous versions, each file was collected and sent by its thread. Although we limited the maximum collection buffer of each file, with the growth of user traffic, the increase in the number of files is inevitable, leading to the simultaneous collection of too many files, causing OOM exceptions due to memory overflow. InLong supports the feature of Agent configuring global flow control in version 1.8.0. With this feature, Agent can effectively avoid frequent OOM problems caused by the growth of file numbers or the use of small quota servers. Thanks to @justinhuang\'s contribution, see INLONG-8251 for details. If you need to use this feature, you can add the corresponding configuration in agent.properties.\\n![1.8.0-agent-flow-controll.png](img/1.8.0/1.8.0-agent-flow-controll.png)\\n\\n### Support multiple Flink versions\\nAs community users go deeper into using InLong, the scenarios InLong faces become more diverse and complex. To support the needs of users in different Flink environments, InLong has added support for multiple Flink versions in the current version. Users can choose the Flink version to start in the plugins/flink-sort-plugin.properties configuration file in InLong-Manager.\\n\\nWhen changing the Flink version required to run the Sort component, you also need to replace the connectors in the InLong-Sort/connector directory with the corresponding version of the jar package. For details, see the InLong official website documentation. Thanks to @Emsnap, @GanfengTan, and @haifxu for their contributions to this capability.\\n```\\n# inLong-manager/plugins/flink-sort-plugin.properties\\n\\n# Flink version, support [1.13|1.15]\\nflink.version=1.13\\n```\\n\\n### Support multi-tenant management\\nTo address the requirements for permission and resource isolation in multi-user scenarios, InLong introduces a multi-tenant architecture in the current version. The multi-tenant architecture ensures that data and permissions do not interfere with each other among different users within the same group of services. Thanks to @vernedeng and @bluewang for their contributions to this feature, see INLONG-7914 for feature details. The following is the core process:\\n![1.8.0-multi-tenant-management.png](img/1.8.0/1.8.0-multi-tenant-management.png)\\n\\nTenants are transparent to core logic developers. At the entrance of the request, tenant authentication is added, and requests without access to the tenant\'s permissions are directly rejected; before accessing the Database, the corresponding tenant filter conditions are added to ensure that the scope of data query and modification is limited within the tenant.\\n\\nUsers can create tenants and assign tenant roles on the Dashboard.\\n![1.8.0-create-tenant.png](img/1.8.0/1.8.0-create-tenant.png)\\n\\n### Support real-time synchronization\\nThe new version supports real-time data synchronization. The main difference between real-time synchronization and data access is that it does not require the support of intermediate MQ storage. The Sort component directly stores the source data, greatly enriching the user\'s usage scenarios.\\n\\nAs shown in the figure below, the Tab page adds a \\"Data Synchronization\\" label. After the user configures the basic Group information, they only need to enter the \\"Data Source\\" and \\"Data Target\\" information, and after submitting the task, the data can be synchronized in real-time.\\n\\nThanks to @fuwen11, @bluewang, @Emsnap, and @haifxu for their contributions to this feature.\\n![1.8.0-realtime-sync.png](img/1.8.0/1.8.0-realtime-sync.png)\\n\\n### Support data preview\\nFor businesses just accessing InLong, data preview can help users quickly confirm the accuracy of reported data and locate problems. In this version, the InLong front supports previewing users\' real-time reported data. Thanks to @fuwen11 and @bluewang\'s contributions, users can choose data preview in the operation bar under the data stream after successfully creating a data stream and reporting data.\\n![1.8.0-data-preview.png](img/1.8.0/1.8.0-data-preview.png)\\n\\n### Support querying transmission delay\\nTransmission delay is crucial for some real-time consumption scenarios. In this version, InLong audit supports frontend viewing of average transmission delay indicators. Thanks to @fuwen11 and @bluewang\'s contributions, users can query link transmission delay after successfully creating a data stream and reporting data.\\n![1.8.0-trans-delay.png](img/1.8.0/1.8.0-trans-delay.png)\\n\\n## Follow-up planning\\nIn version 1.8.0, the community also restructured the DataProxy code, unified the configuration pull interface, supported complete IP and CIDR-based IP segment configuration of black and white list features, and improved module performance and stability. Sort has improved stability in DDL sensing scenarios and supports whole library migration of Hive, Iceberg automatic column update, and column storage features. In subsequent versions, InLong will refactor DataProxy C++ SDK, enrich Flink 1.15 Connector, and improve data synchronization functions, looking forward to more developers participating in the contribution."},{"id":"/2023/05/19/release-1.7.0","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/05/19/release-1.7.0","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/inlong-website/edit/master/blog/blog/2023-05-19-release-1.7.0.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-05-19-release-1.7.0.md","title":"Release 1.7.0","description":"Apache InLong recently released version 1.7.0, which closed about 150+ issues, including 3+ major features and 40+ optimizations.

With this design, users with simple data scenarios and who want to ensure data integrity as much as possible can reduce their dependency on DataProxy. For users accustomed to using Kafka, version 1.7.0 supports the feature of sending data directly from Agent to Kafka. Thanks to @wangpeix for the complete contribution, and details can be found in INLONG-7783. If you want to experience this feature, you can choose \\"Send to MQ, and respond after MQ receives\\" during the data stream approval process.\\n\\n![1.7.0-kafka-stream](img/1.7.0/1.7.0-kafka-stream.png)\\n\\n### MySQL all-database migration with schema change support\\nAs community users delve deeper into using InLong, the drawbacks of not supporting schema changes become increasingly apparent. After the source end changes the DDL, the task needs to modify the configuration and restart, significantly increasing operational costs. In the current version, InLong supports automatic schema change capabilities. Upstream data sources can perceive Create, Alter, Drop, Truncate, and Rename DDL operations and synchronize these operations downstream. Meanwhile, downstream data sources can respond to upstream DDL changes and process them accordingly, supporting different processing strategies. For more details, refer to INLONG-7553. Thanks to @Emsnap, @yunqingmoswu, and @lordcheng10 for contributing to this feature. The following diagram illustrates the core process:\\n\\n![1.7.0-mysql-schema](img/1.7.0/1.7.0-mysql-schema.png)\\n\\nIn the database, DDL messages are perceived by Debezium in the CDC. At this point, the data obtained is a single DDL statement, such as \\"DROP TABLE A\\". This statement is a field in the Debezium JSON. The DDL statement is then parsed into a DDL model by JSQLParser. This model parses common DDL messages and processes them into a JSON format that is easy for the program to handle. The DDL model will be sent to the Sink Operator in Flink as data, and the Operator will process the DDL model.\\n\\n### GH-OST awareness for MySQL all-database migration\\nGH-OST (GitHub Online Schema Migration) is a trigger-free online schema migration solution for MySQL released by GitHub. It is testable and provides pause, dynamic control/reconfiguration, auditing, and many operational privileges. Throughout the migration process, it generates minimal workload on the primary server and is separated from the existing work on the migrated tables. By supporting GH-OST-aware DDL, the MySQL Connector can correctly handle table structure changes caused by GH-OST while capturing data changes. Thanks to @e-mhui for the complete contribution, and details of this feature can be found in INLONG-7554. The following diagram illustrates the core process:\\n\\n![1.7.0-mysql-ghost](img/1.7.0/1.7.0-mysql-ghost.png)\\n\\nFirst, after enabling the automatic DDL response for MySQL CDC, the ghc, gho, and del tables generated by GH-OST are also captured. Second, when perceiving the changes made by GH-OST to the gho table, the gho table in the DDL statement is replaced with the source table and stored in the state. Finally, after GH-OST completes the entire change process for the source table, the DDL statements previously stored in the state are sent downstream.\\n\\n### Addition of 4 batch import modes (CSV, SQL, JSON, and Excel)\\nWhen creating data stream input metadata fields, we need to enter information such as name, type, and description in sequence. If we need to input hundreds or thousands of field information, this processing method is extremely inefficient. In version 1.7.0, InLong has added four batch import modes for CSV/SQL/JSON/Excel formats. Users only need to refer to the template for each format and fill in the selected information to achieve one-time import. Many thanks to @featzhang and @fuweng11 for their participation in the development of this feature. The four batch import modes are now supported by both front-end and back-end, and you can download the latest version for direct use.\\n\\n![1.7.0-batch-add](img/1.7.0/1.7.0-batch-add.png)\\n\\n### Simplification of command line tool for creating data stream configurations\\nIn the before version, when creating a data stream using the command line, the JSON file content required was complex, and the file structure was not clear enough, making the threshold for users to create data streams through the command line very high. Additionally, when users wanted to reuse the file to create a new data stream, they had to modify many repetitive fields, such as inlongGroupID and inlongStreamID. In version 1.7.0, InLong has optimized the data stream configuration JSON structure and field configuration. Users can simply add Source/Sink content according to their data stream requirements, making creating a data stream much simpler than before. For more details, see INLONG-7778, and many thanks to @haifxu for the contribution. \\nThe following example is a template for creating a File -> Pulsar -> Clickhouse in the new version:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\"groupInfo\\": {\\n        \\"inlongGroupId\\": \\"test_group_ctl\\",\\n        \\"inlongClusterTag\\": \\"default_cluster\\",\\n        \\"mqType\\": \\"PULSAR\\"\\n    },\\n    \\"streamInfo\\": {\\n        \\"inlongStreamId\\": \\"test_stream_ctl\\",\\n        \\"fieldList\\": [\\n            {\\n                \\"fieldName\\": \\"name\\",\\n                \\"fieldType\\": \\"string\\"\\n            }\\n        ],\\n        \\"sourceList\\": [\\n            {\\n                \\"sourceType\\": \\"FILE\\",\\n                \\"sourceName\\": \\"test_source_ctl\\",\\n                \\"agentIp\\": \\"127.0.0.1\\",\\n                \\"pattern\\": \\"/data/test.txt\\"\\n            }\\n        ],\\n        \\"sinkList\\": [\\n            {\\n                \\"sinkType\\": \\"CLICKHOUSE\\",\\n                \\"sinkName\\": \\"test_sink_ctl\\",\\n                \\"dataNodeName\\": \\"test_clickhouse\\",\\n                \\"dbName\\": \\"db_test\\",\\n                \\"tableName\\": \\"table_test\\",\\n                \\"flushInterval\\": 1,\\n                \\"flushRecord\\": 1000,\\n                \\"retryTimes\\": 3,\\n                \\"engine\\": \\"Log\\",\\n                \\"isDistributed\\": 1,\\n                \\"sinkFieldList\\": [\\n                    {\\n                        \\"sourceFieldName\\": \\"name\\",\\n                        \\"sourceFieldType\\": \\"string\\",\\n                        \\"fieldName\\": \\"name\\",\\n                        \\"fieldType\\": \\"string\\"\\n                    }\\n                ]\\n            }\\n        ]\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Refactoring of the Dashboard layout\\nIn version 1.7.0, the community has refactored the overall layout of the Dashboard, including adjusting the top-bottom layout to a left-right layout (moving the navigation bar to the left), adding a dark theme, adding icons to the main menu, adjusting the data source selection display and process, etc. This adjustment has improved the user experience of the Dashboard. Special thanks to @leezng and @bluewang for their contributions. For more details, see INLONG-7734.\\n\\n![1.7.0-dashboard-refactor](img/1.7.0/1.7.0-dashboard-refactor.png)\\n\\n## Follow-up planning\\nIn version 1.7.0, the community has also improved the performance and stability of Agent file collection, while TubeMQ has completed the first phase of the Golang SDK production. Additionally, Sort can now consume using the subscription groups allocated by the Manager. In subsequent versions, InLong will support multiple Apache Flink versions, including not only the current Flink 1.13 but also Flink 1.15. Furthermore, tenant management will be added to unify the models of InLong projects, users, and resources. We look forward to more developers participating and contributing."},{"id":"/2023/03/23/release-1.6.0","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/03/23/release-1.6.0","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/inlong-website/edit/master/blog/blog/2023-03-23-release-1.6.0.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-03-23-release-1.6.0.md","title":"Release 1.6.0","description":"Apache InLong recently released version 1.6.0, which closed about 202+ issues, including 11+ major features and 80+ optimizations.

In version 1.6.0, InLong supports the Kudu data stream, including adding Kudu Connector, metadata management, metrics, etc. Kudu data stream contributed by @featzhang independently. Interested users can make an installation and experience.\\n![1.6.0-create-kudu](img/1.6.0/1.6.0-create-kudu.png)\\n\\n### Improved the Redis data stream\\nRedis is a viral open-source memory database with high performance and rich data structure. In version 1.6.0, InLong perfects the Redis data stream, adding SinkFunction, metadata management, indicators, and Dashboard pages in Redis Connector. Supported data formats like Redis\'s PLAIN, Hash, and Bitmap and realized Redis Schema conversion through the SCHEMAMAPPING mechanism. Redis data streams through the SCHEMA mapping mode, and SCHEMA can be converted into different [Redis Data-Type] (https://redis.io/docs/data-types/tutorial/). Redis data stream is mainly contributed to and fulfilled by @featzhang independently. For details, please refer to [INLONG-7060] (https://github.com/apache/inlong/issues/7060).\\n![1.6.0-update-redis](img/1.6.0/1.6.0-update-redis.png)\\n\\n### Added MQ cluster Selector strategy\\nIn the multi-MQ cluster scene, if DataProxy is connected to all MQ clusters simultaneously, the number of producers in the MQ cluster will surge. At the same time, the amount of metadata of ZooKeeeper is excess, which will cause OutOfMemory. In version 1.6.0, InLong increased the selector strategy of the MQ cache cluster level (mainly for Apache Pulsar). As a result, the DataProxy node can only choose some MQ clusters under the same tag for production, thereby reducing the number of producer connections and Zookeeper metadata. @Luchunliang mainly develops this feature. For details, please refer to [INLONG-7231] (https://github.com/apache/inlong/pull/7236).\\n![1.6.0-mq-selector](img/1.6.0/1.6.0-mq-selector.png)\\n\\n### Optimized the Audit ID distribution rules\\nIn the original design of InLong Audit, the receiving and sending number of each module is an independent audit ID, which is used to record the receiving and sending number for each module. There is a defect in this scheme. If InLong Sort sorted data to multiple targets at the same time (such as writing Hive and Clickhouse), the audit ID cannot distinguish different data streams for the Sort. In version 1.6.0, the Audit ID distribution rules are optimized, the different data stream has a different audit ID, achieving data audit of multiple sorting targets for the same data stream. This feature also involves changes in Manager and Sort module. It is developed and implemented by @FuWeng11 and @EMSNAP. For details, please refer to [INLONG-7389] (https://github.com/apache/inlong/pull/7390), [INLONG-7232] (https://github.com/apache/inlong/pull/7233), and [INLONG-7503] (https://github.com/apache/inlong/pull/7552).\\n```sql\\n(\'audit_sort_hive_input\', \'HIVE\', 0, \'7\'),\\n(\'audit_sort_hive_output\', \'HIVE\', 1, \'8\'),\\n(\'audit_sort_clickhouse_input\', \'CLICKHOUSE\', 0, \'9\'),\\n(\'audit_sort_clickhouse_output\', \'CLICKHOUSE\', 1, \'10\'),\\n(\'audit_sort_es_input\', \'ELASTICSEARCH\', 0, \'11\'),\\n(\'audit_sort_es_output\', \'ELASTICSEARCH\', 1, \'12\'),\\n(\'audit_sort_starrocks_input\', \'STARROCKS\', 0, \'13\'),\\n(\'audit_sort_starrocks_output\', \'STARROCKS\', 1, \'14\'),\\n(\'audit_sort_hudi_input\', \'HUDI\', 0, \'15\'),\\n(\'audit_sort_hudi_output\', \'HUDI\', 1, \'16\'),\\n(\'audit_sort_iceberg_input\', \'ICEBERG\', 0, \'17\'),\\n(\'audit_sort_iceberg_output\', \'ICEBERG\', 1, \'18\'),\\n(\'audit_sort_hbase_input\', \'HBASE\', 0, \'19\'),\\n(\'audit_sort_hbase_output\', \'HBASE\', 1, \'20\'),\\n(\'audit_sort_doris_input\', \'DORIS\', 0, \'21\'),\\n(\'audit_sort_doris_output\', \'DORIS\', 1, \'22\')\\n```\\n\\n### Added connection test for new Data Node\\nIn the previous version, InLong added data nodes and registered MQ clusters, and did not judge the availability of the cluster. In the new version, InLong adds a connection test for the main data node and InLong system component registration, which enhances the data stream creation. This feature is mainly participated in development by @leosanqing, @Bluewang, and @Fuweng11.\\n![1.6.0-connection-test](img/1.6.0/1.6.0-connection-test.png)\\n\\n### Optimized reconciliation benchmark time for Sort Audit\\nBefore version 1.6.0, the Sort reconciliation benchmark time is the machine time for data processing. Using this time will cause the full-link reconciliation data to be inaccurate. In this version, the Sort audit reconciliation referred to the design of TimestampedCollector in Apache Flink, replaced the Simple Collector in the original Pulsar Connector, and aligned the audit index. The implementation principle is to set the Timestamp field at the Collector. When obtaining the InLongMsg data transmitted by DataProxy, the reset data time is used as the Audit time record metric when sending the message downstream. The optimized Sort audit index can be aligned with other modules, such as DataProxy, this feature was mainly developed by @Emsnap.\\n![1.6.0-sort-audit-time](img/1.6.0/1.6.0-sort-audit-time.png)\\n\\n### Supported using Kafka as cache MQ for Audit\\nInLong Audit is an independent subsystem that conducts real-time audit reconciliation of the InLong system\'s Agent, DataProxy, and Sort module\'s inflow, and outflow. The current amount of audits is minute, hour, and day. In the previous version, InLong Audit only supports the use of Pulsar to cache audit data, and this will increase the cost of user deployment when they chose Kafka. In the entire InLong Audit design, the choice of MQ type should be consistent with the data stream to avoid different use of different use MQ types. In version 1.6.0, in order to achieve the use of the same type of MQ service in Audit modules and data stream, Audit supports the use of Kafka cache audit data to achieve the unity of MQ service selection. This feature is mainly completed by @haifxu and @dockerzhang.\\n![1.6.0-audit-kafka](img/1.6.0/1.6.0-audit-kafka.png)\\n\\n## Follow-up planning\\nIn 1.6.0, the Sort module also fixes multiple bugs such as dirty data archives, metrics, and Connectors. The Dashboard continues to optimize display and approval processes and other experience problems. For more details, please refer to the Release [Changelog] (https: // github. com/Apache/InLong/Blob/Master/Changes.md). In the subsequent version, Apache InLong will add Schema dynamic change, Schema batch import, agent installation, adding more data nodes, looking forward to more developers participating in contributions."},{"id":"/2023/01/13/release-1.5.0","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/01/13/release-1.5.0","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/inlong-website/edit/master/blog/blog/2023-01-13-release-1.5.0.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-01-13-release-1.5.0.md","title":"Release 1.5.0","description":"Apache InLong recently released version 1.5.0, which closed about 296+ issues, including 12+ major features and 110+ optimizations.

These new data nodes are mainly contributed by @liaorui, @featzhang, @kuansix, @LvJiancheng, and other developers.\\n![1.5.0-create-hudi-source](img/1.5.0/1.5.0-create-hudi-source.png)\\n\\n### Optimization of the Dashboard Experience\\nCompared with traditional data integration projects, InLong has added concepts such as Group, Stream, and data nodes. Community users using Dashboard for the first time will be confused about the whole process. To reduce the cost of using Dashboard users, InLong has made a lot of optimizations for the Dashboard front-end page, with more than 50 optimization points, and adjusted the concept, process, and display. The figure below shows the process of creating a Stream in 1.5.0, which is more simplified than the previous version. Special thanks to @leezng, @bluewang, @kinfuy for optimizing the Dashboard and @Charles Zhang for the modification suggestions.\\n![1.5.0-create-dashboard-stream](img/1.5.0/1.5.0-create-dashboard-stream.png)\\n\\n### Refactor the MQ Management Model\\nTo quickly support new message queue services (such as RocketMQ) to implement plug-ins, and unify the existing support for Pulsar, Kafka, and TubeMQ, in version 1.5.0, InLong DataProxy refactored the MQ management model, and all MQ types are based on `MessageQueueHandler ` Implement the corresponding `Handler`. Thanks to @woofyzhao and @luchunliang for the implementation of this feature. If you need to develop a new MQ type, you can refer to the DataProxy plug-in guide.\\n![1.5.0-mq-handler](img/1.5.0/1.5.0-mq-handler.png)\\n\\n### Support Dirty Data Processing\\nIf there is dirty data that does not meet the data specifications (such as field range exceeding, missing data fields, etc.) when entering the lake into the warehouse, it may cause the user task to fail to write and restart continuously. In version 1.5.0, InLong supports storing unrecoverable dirty data in external storage, including S3 and local logs. At the same time, users can customize the output port of dirty data and can configure \\"whether to enable dirty data archiving\\" and \\"whether to ignore write entry error\\", as follows to design a UML diagram for dirty data archiving. The realization of this feature is thanks to the support of @yunqingmoswu and @Yizhou-Yang.\\n![1.5.0-dirty-data](img/1.5.0/1.5.0-dirty-data.png)\\n\\n### Support Apache Kafka Full-link\\nIn version 1.5.0, the DataProxy, Manager, Sort, and Dashboard modules have completed the full-link support for Apache Kafka. The support for Kafka has gone through two versions, and it is available for production in 1.5.0. When users create data streams Just choose Kafka. The implementation of this feature is thanks to @woofyzhao, @fuweng11, @haifxu for their support.\\n![1.5.0-support-kafka](img/1.5.0/1.5.0-support-kafka.png)\\n\\nFor more details on the 1.5.0 release, please refer to the release notes, which detail the features, enhancements, and bug fixes for this release.\\n\\n## Follow-up planning\\nIn the following versions, Apache InLong will add multi-tenant management, standardize data flow, resources, and permissions of projects, clusters, and users, and optimize the performance and stability of various data sources, Agent management, etc., expect more developers to participate and contribute."},{"id":"/2022/11/16/release-1.4.0","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/11/16/release-1.4.0","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/inlong-website/edit/master/blog/blog/2022-11-16-release-1.4.0.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-11-16-release-1.4.0.md","title":"Release 1.4.0","description":"Apache InLong is a one-stop integration framework for massive data that provides automatic, secure and reliable data transmission capabilities.","date":"2022-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 16, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Apache InLong","permalink":"/blog/tags/apache-in-long"},{"label":"Version","permalink":"/blog/tags/version"}],"readingTime":3.575,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Charles Zhang","url":"https://github.com/dockerzhang","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18047329?v=4"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Release 1.4.0","author":"Charles Zhang","author_url":"https://github.com/dockerzhang","author_image_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18047329?v=4","tags":["Apache InLong","Version"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Release 1.5.0","permalink":"/blog/2023/01/13/release-1.5.0"},"nextItem":{"title":"Release 1.3.0","permalink":"/blog/2022/09/05/release-1.3.0"}},"content":"Apache InLong is a one-stop integration framework for massive data that provides automatic, secure and reliable data transmission capabilities.\\nInLong offers great power to build data analysis, modeling and other real-time applications based on streaming data.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## 1.4.0 version overview\\nApache InLong recently released version 1.4.0, which closed about 364+ issues with 16+ features and 120+ optimizations.

Background\\n\\nWith the increasing number of users and developers of Apache InLong(incubating), the demand for richer usage scenarios and low-cost operation is getting stronger and stronger. Among them, the demand for adding Transform (T) to the whole link of InLong has received the most feedback. After the research and design of @yunqingmoswu, @EMsnap, @gong, @thexiay community developers, the InLong Sort ETL solution based on Flink SQL has been completed. This article will introduce the implementation details of the solution in detail.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nFirstly, based on Apache Flink SQL, there are mainly the following considerations\uff1a\\n\\n-  Flink SQL has high scalability and flexibility brought about by its powerful expression ability. Basically, Flink SQL can support most demand scenarios in the community. When the built-in functions of Flink SQL do not meet the requirements, we can also extend them through various UDFs.\\n-  Compared with the implementation of the underlying API of Flink, the development cost of Flink SQL is lower. Only for the first time, the conversion logic of Flink SQL needs to be implemented. In the future, we can focus on the construction of the ability of Flink SQL, such as the extension connector and the UDF.\\n- In general, Flink SQL will be more robust and run more stable. The reason is that Flink SQL shields a lot of the underlying details of Flink, has strong community support, and has been practiced by a large number of users.\\n- For users, Flink SQL is also easier to understand, especially for users who have used SQL, the usage is simple and familiar, which helps users to land quickly.\\n- For the migration of existing real-time tasks, if they are originally SQL-type tasks, especially Flink SQL tasks, the migration cost is extremely low, and in some cases, no changes are even required.\\n\\n**Note**: For all codes of this scheme, please refer to [Apache InLong Sort](https://github.com/apache/incubator-inlong/tree/master/inlong-sort), which can be downloaded and used in the upcoming version 1.2.0.\\n\\n## 2. Introduction\\n\\n### 2.1 Requirements\\n\\nThe main requirements of this solution are the completed inlong sort module transform (T) capability, including:\\n\\n|          Transform          |                            Notes                             |\\n| :-------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |\\n| Deduplication in the window |            Deduplicate data within a time window             |\\n|   time window aggregation   |             Aggregate data within a time window              |\\n|   time format conversion    | Converts the value of a field to a string in the target time format |\\n|     field segmentation      |    Split a field into multiple new fields by a delimiter     |\\n|     string replacement      |    Replace some or all of the contents of a string field     |\\n|       Data filtering        |   Discard or retain data that meets the filter conditions    |\\n|     Content extraction      |        Extract part of a field to create a new field         |\\n|            Join             |                    Support two table join                    |\\n|     Value substitution      | Given a matching value, if the field\'s value is equal to that value, replace it with the target value |\\n\\n### 2.2 Usage Scenarios\\n\\nUsers of big data integration have transform requirements such as data transformation, connection and filtering in many business scenarios.\\n\\n### 2.3 Design Goal\\n\\nThis design needs to achieve the following goals:\\n\\n- Functionality: Under InLong Sort\'s existing architecture and data flow model, it covers basic Transform capabilities and has the ability to expand rapidly.\\n- Compatibility: The new InLong Sort data model is forward compatible to ensure that historical tasks can be configured and run properly.\\n- Maintainability: The conversion of the InLong Sort data model to Flink SQL only needs to be implemented once. When there are new functional requirements later, this part does not need to be changed, even if there are changes, it can be supported with a small amount of changes.\\n- Extensibility: When the open source Flink Connector or the built-in Flink SQL function does not meet the requirements, you can customize the Flink Connector and UDF to achieve its function expansion.\\n\\n### 2.4 Basic Concepts\\n\\nThe core concept refers to the explanation of terms in the outline design\\n\\n|            Name             |                           Meaning                            |\\n| :-------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |\\n|      InLong Dashboard       |            Inlong front end management interface             |\\n|    InLong Manager Client    | Wrap the interface in the manager for external user programs to call without going through the front-end inlong dashboard |\\n|   InLong Manager Openapi    |      Inlong manager and external system call interface       |\\n|   InLong Manager metaData   | Inlong manager metadata management, including metadata information of group and stream dimensions |\\n| InLong Manager task manager | Inlong manager manages the data source collection task module, manages agent task distribution, instruction distribution, and heartbeat reporting |\\n|        InLong Group         | Data flow group, including multiple data flows, one group represents one data access |\\n|        InLong Stream        |     Data flow: a data flow has a specific flow direction     |\\n|        Stream Source        | There are corresponding acquisition end and sink end in the stream.

Through Manager Client, users can build InLong into any third-party platform to achieve unified customized platform construction. The Manager Client is mainly designed and implemented by @kipshi, @gong, @ciscozhou, thanks to three contributors.\\n\\n### Add ManagerCtl command line tool\\nManagerCtl is developed based on Manager Client and is a command-line tool for manipulating InLong resources, which can further simplify the use of developers. ManagerCtl was contributed independently by @haifxu and includes guidelines including:\\n```\\nUsage: managerctl [options] [command] [command options]\\nOptions:\\n-h, --help\\nGet all command about managerctl.\\nCommands:\\ncreate      Create resource by json file\\nUsage: create [options]\\n\u200b\\ndescribe      Display details of one or more resources\\nUsage: describe [options]\\n\u200b\\nlist      Displays main information for one or more resources\\nUsage: list [options]\\n```\\n\\n### Manager supports issuing Sort tasks\\nIn previous versions, after the user created the data group/stream task, Sort needed to submit it to the Flink cluster through the command line, and then perform data sorting. In version 1.1.0, we unified the start, stop, and suspend operations of Sort tasks to the Manager to complete. Users only need to configure the correct Flink cluster when the Manager is deployed. When the data stream is approved, Sort will be automatically started. \\nThis part of the work is mainly contributed by @LvJiancheng.\\n\\n### Manager metadata is saved to ZooKeeper\\nInLong uses ZooKeeper to save data stream metadata, which increases the deployment threshold and operation and maintenance difficulty for developers and users. \\nIn version 1.1.0, we save data stream metadata in DB by default, and ZooKeeper is only an optional solution in large-scale scenarios. Thanks to @kipshi @yunqingmoswu for contributing a PR to ZooKeeper.\\n\\n### Support MySQL Binlog collection\\nVersion 1.1.0 fully supports the collection of data from MySQL, and supports both incremental and full strategies. Users can collect MySQL data with simple configuration in InLong. This part of the work was contributed by @EMsnap.\\n\\n### Sort Added Iceberg, ClickHouse, Kafka\\nIn version 1.1.0, the storage of data nodes for various scenarios has been added, including Iceberg, ClickHouse, and Kafka. The support of these three streams enriches the usage scenarios of InLong. New stream support, mainly contributed by @chantccc @KevinWen007 @healchow.\\n\\n### Sort Standalone supports Hive, Elasticsearch, Kafka\\nAs mentioned in the previous version, for non-Flink environments, we can sort data streams through Sort Standalone. In version 1.1.0, we added support for Hive, ElasticSearch, Kafka, and expanded the usage scenarios of Sort Standalone. Sort Standalone is mainly contributed by @vernedeng @luchunliang.\\n\\n### Protocol Buffers upgrade\\nAll InLong components Protocol Buffers dependencies have been upgraded from 2.5.0 to 3.19.4. Thanks to @gosonzhang @doleyzi for their contributions, a lot of compatibility and testing work for Protocol Buffers upgrades.\\n\\n### InLong on Kubernetes optimization\\nThe optimization work of InLong on Kubernetes mainly includes adding Audit, combing configuration, optimizing the use of message queues, optimizing the use of documents, etc., to facilitate the use of InLong on the cloud. Thanks to @shink for contributing to these optimizations.\\n\\n### Dashboard plugin\\nIn order to facilitate users to quickly build new data stream on Dashboard, Dashboard is support plugin in version 1.1.0. JavaScript developers who understand the plugin development guidelines can quickly expand new data stream. Thanks for this part of the work @leezng\\n\\n### Other features and bug fixes\\nFor related content, please refer to the version [release notes](https://github.com/apache/incubator-inlong/blob/master/CHANGES.md), which list the features, enhancements and bug fixes of this version in detail, as well as specific contributors.\\n\\n## Apache InLong(incubating) follow-up planning\\nIn subsequent versions, we will support lightweight Sort, and expand more data sources and targets to cover more usage scenarios, including:\\n- Flink SQL support\\n- Elasticsearch, HBase support"},{"id":"/2022/01/04/release-0.12.0","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/01/04/release-0.12.0","editUrl":"https://github.com/apache/inlong-website/edit/master/blog/blog/2022-01-04-release-0.12.0.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-01-04-release-0.12.0.md","title":"Release 0.12.0","description":"InLong: the sacred animal in Chinese myths stories, draws rivers into the sea, as a metaphor for the InLong system to provide data access capabilities.","date":"2022-01-04T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 4, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Apache InLong","permalink":"/blog/tags/apache-in-long"},{"label":"Version","permalink":"/blog/tags/version"}],"readingTime":5.155,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"gosonzhang","url":"https://github.com/gosonzhang","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14038849?v=4"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Release 0.12.0","author":"gosonzhang","author_url":"https://github.com/gosonzhang","author_image_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14038849?v=4","tags":["Apache InLong","Version"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Release 1.1.0","permalink":"/blog/2022/04/25/release-1.1.0"},"nextItem":{"title":"Release 0.11.0","permalink":"/blog/2021/11/10/release-0.11.0"}},"content":"InLong: the sacred animal in Chinese myths stories, draws rivers into the sea, as a metaphor for the InLong system to provide data access capabilities.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nApache InLong is a one-stop integration framework for massive data that provides automatic, secure and reliable data transmission capabilities.

It provides automatic,  safe,  reliable,  and high-performance data transmission capabilities to facilitate the construction of streaming-based data analysis,  modeling,  and applications.  \\nThe Apache InLong project was originally called TubeMQ,  focusing on high-performance,  low-cost message queuing services.  In order to further release the surrounding ecological capabilities of TubeMQ,  we upgraded the project to InLong,  focusing on creating a one-stop integration framework for massive data.\\n\\nApache InLong uses TDBank internally used by Tencent as the prototype,  and relies on trillion-level data access and processing capabilities to integrate the entire process of data collection,  aggregation,  storage,  and sorting data processing.  It is simple to use,  flexible to expand,  stable and reliable characteristic.\\n<img src=\\"/img/inlong-structure-en.png\\" align=\\"center\\" alt=\\"Apache InLong\\"/>\\n\\nApache InLong serves the entire life cycle from data collection to landing,  and provides different processing modules according to different stages of data,  including the next modules:\\n- **inlong-agent**,  data collection agent, supports reading regular logs from specified directories or files and reporting data one by one.  In the future,  DB collection and HTTP reporting capabilities will also be expanded.\\n- **inlong-dataproxy**,  a Proxy component based on Flume-ng,  supports data transmission blocking,  placing retransmission, and has the ability to forward received data to different MQ (message queues).\\n- **inlong-tubemq**,  Tencent\'s self-developed message queuing service,  focuses on high-performance storage and transmission of massive data in big data scenarios and has a relatively good core advantage in mass practice and low cost.\\n- **inlong-sort**,  after consuming data from different MQ services,  perform ETL processing,  and then aggregate and write the data into Apache Hive, ClickHouse,  Hbase,  IceBerg,  etc.\\n- **inlong-manager**, provides complete data service management and control capabilities,  including metadata,  OpenAPI,  task flow,  authority,  etc.\\n- **inlong-website**, a front-end page for managing data access,  simplifying the use of the entire InLong control platform.\\n\\n### What\u2019s New in Apache InLong(incubating) 0.12.0\\n#### 1. Support Apache Pulsar data cache\\nIn version 0.12.0, we have completed the data reporting capability of FileAgent\u2192DataProxy\u2192Pulsar\u2192Sort. So far, InLong supports high-performance and high-reliability data access scenarios: Compared with the high-throughput TubeMQ, Apache Pulsar can provide better data consistency and is more suitable for scenarios that require extremely high data reliability. For example, finance and billing.\\n<img src=\\"/img/pulsar-arch-en.png\\" align=\\"center\\" alt=\\"Report via Pulsar\\"/>\\n\\nThanks to @healchow, @baomingyu, @leezng, @bruceneenhl, @ifndef-SleePy and others for their contributions to this feature.
