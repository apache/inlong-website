This version includes next features:\\n- Lower the user\'s threshold for use further.  Support all modules of InLong to be deployed on Kubernetes,  and refactor the official website,  so that users can more easily access related documents.\\n- Support more usage scenarios,  increase the data flow direction of `Dataproxy -> Pulsar`,  and cover scenarios with higher requirements for data integrity and consistency.\\n- Supports SDKs in more languages for TubeMQ.  This version opens the production-level TubeMQ Go SDK, which is convenient for users who use the Go language to access\\n\\nThis version closed more than 80 issues, including four significant features and 35 improvements.\\n\\n### Apache InLong(incubating) Introduction\\n[Apache InLong](https://inlong.apache.org) is a one-stop integration framework for massive data donated by Tencent to the Apache community.  It provides automatic,  safe,  reliable,  and high-performance data transmission capabilities to facilitate the construction of streaming-based data analysis,  modeling,  and applications.  \\nThe Apache InLong project was originally called TubeMQ,  focusing on high-performance,  low-cost message queuing services.  In order to further release the surrounding ecological capabilities of TubeMQ,  we upgraded the project to InLong,  focusing on creating a one-stop integration framework for massive data.\\n\\nApache InLong uses TDBank internally used by Tencent as the prototype,  and relies on trillion-level data access and processing capabilities to integrate the entire process of data collection,  aggregation,  storage,  and sorting data processing.  It is simple to use,  flexible to expand,  stable and reliable characteristic.\\n<img src=\\"/img/inlong-structure-en.png\\" align=\\"center\\" alt=\\"Apache InLong\\"/>\\n\\nApache InLong serves the entire life cycle from data collection to landing,  and provides different processing modules according to different stages of data,  including the next modules:\\n- **inlong-agent**,  data collection agent, supports reading regular logs from specified directories or files and reporting data one by one.  In the future,  DB collection and HTTP reporting capabilities will also be expanded.\\n- **inlong-dataproxy**,  a Proxy component based on Flume-ng,  supports data transmission blocking,  placing retransmission, and has the ability to forward received data to different MQ (message queues).\\n- **inlong-tubemq**,  Tencent\'s self-developed message queuing service,  focuses on high-performance storage and transmission of massive data in big data scenarios and has a relatively good core advantage in mass practice and low cost.\\n- **inlong-sort**,  after consuming data from different MQ services,  perform ETL processing,  and then aggregate and write the data into Apache Hive, ClickHouse,  Hbase,  IceBerg,  etc.\\n- **inlong-manager**, provides complete data service management and control capabilities,  including metadata,  OpenAPI,  task flow,  authority,  etc.\\n- **inlong-website**, a front-end page for managing data access,  simplifying the use of the entire InLong control platform.\\n\\n### What\u2019s New in Apache InLong(incubating) 0.11.0\\n#### InLong on Kubernetes \\nApache InLong includes multiple components such as data collection,  data aggregation,  data caching,  data sorting,  and cluster management and control.  In order to facilitate users to use and support cloud-native features,  all components currently support deployment in Kubernetes.\\nThanks to @shink for contributing to this feature.  For specific details,  please refer to [INLONG-1308](https://github.com/apache/incubator-inlong/issues/1308).\\n\\n#### Open up dataproxy->pulsar data flow\\nBefore version 0.11.0,  InLong\'s data caching layer could only support TubeMQ.  TubeMQ is very suitable for scenarios with huge data volumes,  but in extreme scenarios,  there may be a small amount of data loss. To provide data reliability, the Inlong added support for Apache Pulsar in version 0.11.0.  Now InLong backend can support data flow `agent -> dataProxy -> tubeMQ/pulsar -> sort.` The introduction of Pulsar makes the application scenarios covered by InLong more abundant,  which could meet the needs of more users.\\nThanks to @baomingyu for his contribution to this feature.  For more details,  please refer to [INLONG-1330](https://github.com/apache/incubator-inlong/issues/1330).\\n\\n#### Go SDK for InLong TubeMQ\\nBefore version 0.11.0,  InLong TubeMQ supports SDKs in three languages:  Java,  C++,  and Python.  With more and more applications of Go language,  the demand for Go language SDK in the community is also increasing. Version 0.11.0 was officially introduced to the Go language SDK of TubeMQ.  The multilingual SDK is enriched,  and the difficulty of access and use for Go language users is also reduced.\\nThanks to @TszKitLo40 for contributing to this feature.

Support Apache Pulsar data cache\\nIn version 0.12.0, we have completed the data reporting capability of FileAgent\u2192DataProxy\u2192Pulsar\u2192Sort. So far, InLong supports high-performance and high-reliability data access scenarios: Compared with the high-throughput TubeMQ, Apache Pulsar can provide better data consistency and is more suitable for scenarios that require extremely high data reliability. For example, finance and billing.\\n<img src=\\"/img/pulsar-arch-en.png\\" align=\\"center\\" alt=\\"Report via Pulsar\\"/>\\n\\nThanks to @healzhou, @baomingyu, @leezng, @bruceneenhl, @ifndef-SleePy and others for their contributions to this feature. For more information, please refer to [INLONG-1310](https://github.com/apache/)incubator-inlong/issues/1310), please refer to [Pulsar usage example](https://inlong.apache. org/zh -CN/docs/next/quick_start/pulsar_example/) to get the usage guide.\\n\\n#### 2. Support JMX and Prometheus metrics\\nIn addition to the existing file output metrics, the various components of InLong began to gradually support the output of JMX and Prometheus metrics to improve the visibility of the entire system. Currently, modules including Agent, DataProxy, TubeMQ, Sort-Standalone, etc. already support the above metrics, and the documentation of metrics output by each module is being sorted out.\\n\\nThanks to @shink, @luchunliang, @EMsnap, @gosonzhang and others for their contributions.

Function extension of the modules\\nThe Sort module adds support for Apache Doris storage and realizes the ability to load sorted data into Apache Doris, giving InLong one more storage option. In addition, in order to enrich the functions of the entire data access process, the Audit and Sort-Standalone modules have been added:\\n- The Audit module provides the ability to reconcile the entire process of data flow, and monitor the service quality of the system through data flow indicators;\\n- Sort-Standalone module is a non-Flink-based data sorting module. It adds lightweight data sorting capabilities to the system, facilitating the rapid construction and use of businesses.\\n\\nThe Audit and Sort-Standalone modules are still under development and will be released when the version is stable.\\n\\nThanks to @huzk8, @doleyzi, @luchunliang and others for their contributions, please refer to [INLONG-1821](https://github.com/apache/incubator-inlong/issues/1821), [INLONG-1738]( https: / /github.com/apache/incubator-inlong/issues/1738), [INLONG-1889](https://github.com/apache/incubator-inlong/issues/1889).\\n\\n#### 4. Official website document directory reconstruction\\nIn addition to the improvement of functional modules in version 0.12.0, the official website structure and the use of documents have also been deeply adjusted, including the reconstruction of the document directory structure, supplementing and improving the function introduction of each module, adding document translation, and further improving the documentation of the InLong official website. Readability, to achieve quick search and easy reading. You can check the official website to understand this content. The document is still under construction.
