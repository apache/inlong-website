            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apache InLong (incubating)  has been renamed from the original Apache TubeMQ (incubating) from 0.9.0.  With the name change,  InLong has also been upgraded from a single message queue to a one-stop integration framework for massive data.  InLong supports data collection,  aggregation,  caching,  and sorting,  users can import data from the data source to the real-time computing engine or land to offline storage with a simple configuration.
The just-released version <code>0.11.0-incubating</code> is the third version after the name changed.  This version includes next features:</p><ul><li>Lower the user's threshold for use further.  Support all modules of InLong to be deployed on Kubernetes,  and refactor the official website,  so that users can more easily access related documents.</li><li>Support more usage scenarios,  increase the data flow direction of <code>Dataproxy -&gt; Pulsar</code>,  and cover scenarios with higher requirements for data integrity and consistency.</li><li>Supports SDKs in more languages for TubeMQ.  This version opens the production-level TubeMQ Go SDK, which is convenient for users who use the Go language to access</li></ul><p>This version closed more than 80 issues, including four significant features and 35 improvements.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="apache-inlongincubating-introduction">Apache InLong(incubating) Introduction<a class="hash-link" href="#apache-inlongincubating-introduction" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p><a href="https://inlong.apache.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apache InLong</a> is a one-stop integration framework for massive data donated by Tencent to the Apache community.

Thanks to @shink for contributing to this feature.  For specific details,  please refer to <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-inlong/issues/1308" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">INLONG-1308</a>.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="open-up-dataproxy-pulsar-data-flow">Open up dataproxy-&gt;pulsar data flow<a class="hash-link" href="#open-up-dataproxy-pulsar-data-flow" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Before version 0.11.0,  InLong's data caching layer could only support TubeMQ.  TubeMQ is very suitable for scenarios with huge data volumes,  but in extreme scenarios,  there may be a small amount of data loss. To provide data reliability, the Inlong added support for Apache Pulsar in version 0.11.0.  Now InLong backend can support data flow <code>agent -&gt; dataProxy -&gt; tubeMQ/pulsar -&gt; sort.</code> The introduction of Pulsar makes the application scenarios covered by InLong more abundant,  which could meet the needs of more users.

With more and more applications of Go language,  the demand for Go language SDK in the community is also increasing. Version 0.11.0 was officially introduced to the Go language SDK of TubeMQ.  The multilingual SDK is enriched,  and the difficulty of access and use for Go language users is also reduced.
