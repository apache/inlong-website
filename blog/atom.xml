        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apache InLong (incubating)  has been renamed from the original Apache TubeMQ (incubating) from 0.9.0.  With the name change,  InLong has also been upgraded from a single message queue to a one-stop integration framework for massive data.  InLong supports data collection,  aggregation,  caching,  and sorting,  users can import data from the data source to the real-time computing engine or land to offline storage with a simple configuration.
The just-released version <code>0.11.0-incubating</code> is the third version after the name changed.  This version includes next features:</p><ul><li>Lower the user's threshold for use further.  Support all modules of InLong to be deployed on Kubernetes,  and refactor the official website,  so that users can more easily access related documents.</li><li>Support more usage scenarios,  increase the data flow direction of <code>Dataproxy -&gt; Pulsar</code>,  and cover scenarios with higher requirements for data integrity and consistency.</li><li>Supports SDKs in more languages for TubeMQ.  This version opens the production-level TubeMQ Go SDK, which is convenient for users who use the Go language to access</li></ul><p>This version closed more than 80 issues, including four significant features and 35 improvements.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="apache-inlongincubating-introduction">Apache InLong(incubating) Introduction<a class="hash-link" href="#apache-inlongincubating-introduction" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p><a href="https://inlong.apache.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apache InLong</a> is a one-stop integration framework for massive data donated by Tencent to the Apache community.

Thanks to @shink for contributing to this feature.  For specific details,  please refer to <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-inlong/issues/1308" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">INLONG-1308</a>.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="open-up-dataproxy-pulsar-data-flow">Open up dataproxy-&gt;pulsar data flow<a class="hash-link" href="#open-up-dataproxy-pulsar-data-flow" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Before version 0.11.0,  InLong's data caching layer could only support TubeMQ.  TubeMQ is very suitable for scenarios with huge data volumes,  but in extreme scenarios,  there may be a small amount of data loss. To provide data reliability, the Inlong added support for Apache Pulsar in version 0.11.0.  Now InLong backend can support data flow <code>agent -&gt; dataProxy -&gt; tubeMQ/pulsar -&gt; sort.</code> The introduction of Pulsar makes the application scenarios covered by InLong more abundant,  which could meet the needs of more users.

With more and more applications of Go language,  the demand for Go language SDK in the community is also increasing. Version 0.11.0 was officially introduced to the Go language SDK of TubeMQ.  The multilingual SDK is enriched,  and the difficulty of access and use for Go language users is also reduced.

Through Manager Client, users can build InLong into any third-party platform to achieve unified customized platform construction. The Manager Client is mainly designed and implemented by @kipshi, @gong, @ciscozhou, thanks to three contributors.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="add-managerctl-command-line-tool">Add ManagerCtl command line tool<a class="hash-link" href="#add-managerctl-command-line-tool" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>ManagerCtl is developed based on Manager Client and is a command-line tool for manipulating InLong resources, which can further simplify the use of developers. ManagerCtl was contributed independently by @haifxu and includes guidelines including:</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">Usage: managerctl [options] [command] [command options]</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">Options:</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">-h, --help</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">Get all command about managerctl.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">Commands:</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">create      Create resource by json file</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">Usage: create [options]</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">​</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">describe      Display details of one or more resources</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">Usage: describe [options]</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">​</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">list      Displays main information for one or more resources</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">Usage: list [options]</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="manager-supports-issuing-sort-tasks">Manager supports issuing Sort tasks<a class="hash-link" href="#manager-supports-issuing-sort-tasks" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>In previous versions, after the user created the data group/stream task, Sort needed to submit it to the Flink cluster through the command line, and then perform data sorting. In version 1.1.0, we unified the start, stop, and suspend operations of Sort tasks to the Manager to complete. Users only need to configure the correct Flink cluster when the Manager is deployed. When the data stream is approved, Sort will be automatically started.
This part of the work is mainly contributed by @LvJiancheng.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="manager-metadata-is-saved-to-zookeeper">Manager metadata is saved to ZooKeeper<a class="hash-link" href="#manager-metadata-is-saved-to-zookeeper" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>InLong uses ZooKeeper to save data stream metadata, which increases the deployment threshold and operation and maintenance difficulty for developers and users.
In version 1.1.0, we save data stream metadata in DB by default, and ZooKeeper is only an optional solution in large-scale scenarios. Thanks to @kipshi @yunqingmoswu for contributing a PR to ZooKeeper.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="support-mysql-binlog-collection">Support MySQL Binlog collection<a class="hash-link" href="#support-mysql-binlog-collection" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Version 1.1.0 fully supports the collection of data from MySQL, and supports both incremental and full strategies. Users can collect MySQL data with simple configuration in InLong.

The support of these three streams enriches the usage scenarios of InLong. New stream support, mainly contributed by @chantccc @KevinWen007 @healchow.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="sort-standalone-supports-hive-elasticsearch-kafka">Sort Standalone supports Hive, Elasticsearch, Kafka<a class="hash-link" href="#sort-standalone-supports-hive-elasticsearch-kafka" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>As mentioned in the previous version, for non-Flink environments, we can sort data streams through Sort Standalone. In version 1.1.0, we added support for Hive, ElasticSearch, Kafka, and expanded the usage scenarios of Sort Standalone. Sort Standalone is mainly contributed by @vernedeng @luchunliang.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="protocol-buffers-upgrade">Protocol Buffers upgrade<a class="hash-link" href="#protocol-buffers-upgrade" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>All InLong components Protocol Buffers dependencies have been upgraded from 2.5.0 to 3.19.4.
