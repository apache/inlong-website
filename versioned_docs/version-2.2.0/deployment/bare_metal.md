You can get binary package from [Download Page](https://inlong.apache.org/download) ,or you can build the InLong refer to [How to Build](../development/how_to_build.md).ã€‚

## Standard Architecture
You need deploy all InLong components for Standard Architecture, which supports `Data Ingestion`, `Data Synchronization` and `Data Subscription` at the same time.

### Deploy
| order | component              | dependencies                  | deploy guide                                                                                                                                                 | description |

### Create Data Stream
After the InLong cluster deployed successfully, you can create a data stream refer to the [Dashboard Usage Guide](user_guide/dashboard_usage.md) to start using.

## Lightweight Architecture
### Deploy
Lightweight Architecture only support `Data Synchronization`, you need to deploy InLong Sort component, it is simple and flexible, suitable for small-scale data.
You can deploy and use it refer [the deployment guide](modules/sort/deployment.md).
