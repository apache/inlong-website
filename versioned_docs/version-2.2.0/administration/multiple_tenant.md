## Overview

Multi-tenancy is a software architecture pattern that allows a single application to serve multiple independent users or organizations (called "tenants") simultaneously. 
In this model, each tenant is logically isolated from one another but shares the same underlying software infrastructure and resources.
This means that a single application instance can serve multiple tenants without the need to deploy and maintain the application separately for each tenant.
In order to address the requirements for permissions and resource isolation in multi-user scenarios, InLong introduced a multi-tenant architecture in version 1.8.0.

For the implementation of InLong multi-tenancy, please refer to:
https://github.com/apache/inlong/issues/7914

:::caution
- Resources and permissions are isolated between different tenants, and users can only see resources under their tenant.
- After upgrading from a lower version to version 1.8.0, all resources will be migrated to the `public` tenant.
