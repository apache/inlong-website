## Overview
The platform has implemented interface based management capabilities for agents, supporting installation package management, version management, installation operations, uninstallation operations, upgrade operations, restart operations, and batch operations.

## Installation package management
Installation package management mainly involves managing the name, address, and MD5 of installation packages.
### Add
As shown in the figure, click "Create Package" in "Operation-Package" to create a new installation package:

### Installer 
The Installer is the daemon process of the Agent, and in fact, we install both the Installer and Agent processes on the business machine. The installation package, version management, and agent of the Installer are the same.

## Version Management
Version management is based on installation package management, mainly managing the installation, inspection, start, and stop commands required for this installation package.
