## 1 Introduction to TubeMQ metric set

TubeMQ has supported the output of JMX metric items since version 0.12.0. At present, it mainly adds overall operating metrics to the Master and Broker modules; in the future, we will consider adding corresponding metrics to the Producer and Consumer modules. At the same time, the metrics of the Master and Broker modules are implemented as needed to continue to expand.

The indicator output format currently only supports the standard JMX access method, next, Prometheus and HTTP access mode will be added. The metrics' values are obtained through the getMetrics() and getAndReSetMetrics() methods: getMetrics() only pulls the indicator data, and does not change the current data metric value; the getAndReSetMetrics() method performs the pull of the current metric data, for the Counter and The maximum and minimum metrics are reset to facilitate business re-statistics of system operation.

## 2 Master Metric Items

|       Metric Item         |          Metric Type        |                  Desc                      |
