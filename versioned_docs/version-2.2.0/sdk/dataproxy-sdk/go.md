## Create real-time synchronization task
Create a task on the Dashboard or with the command line tool, and set `Auto Push` (autonomous push) as the data source type.

## Import Golang SDK
To use the Golang SDK, you need to import it into your projects. Import the Golang SDK:

```go
import "github.com/apache/inlong/inlong-sdk/dataproxy-sdk-twins/dataproxy-sdk-golang/dataproxy"
```


## Data report process
After importing the SDK, you can initialize a [Client](https://github.com/apache/inlong/tree/master/inlong-sdk/dataproxy-sdk-twins/dataproxy-sdk-golang/dataproxy/client.go) instance, and then call `Send()` or `SendAsync()` to produce messages to DataProxy, SDK will put the messages with a same StreamID into a batch and send them together. A demo can be found at: [example_test.go](https://github.com/apache/inlong/tree/master/inlong-sdk/dataproxy-sdk-twins/dataproxy-sdk-golang/dataproxy/example_test.go).
Basically, there are 3 steps to produce messages:

### Initialize the SDK
```go
client, err := dataproxy.NewClient(
	dataproxy.WithGroupID("test"),		      	
    dataproxy.WithURL("http://127.0.0.1:8083/inlong/manager/openapi/dataproxy/getIpList"),
	dataproxy.WithMetricsName("test"),
)

if err != nil {
	fmt.Println(err)
	return
}
```

Parameters:

- `dataproxy.WithGroupID("test")` sets the GroupID;
- `dataproxy.WithURL("http://127.0.0.1:8083/inlong/manager/openapi/dataproxy/getIpList")` sets the Manager URL;
- `dataproxy.WithMetricsName("test")` sets the value of the metrics label: "name" of the `Client`.

### Call the Send/SendAsync method to send

The send methods of the SDK are goroutine safe, you can send a message synchronously or asynchronously, there are both synchronous and asynchronous examples in the demo.

Send synchronously :

```go
for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
    err := client.Send(context.Background(), dataproxy.Message{
		GroupID:  "test",
		StreamID: "test",
		Payload:  []byte("test|a|b|c"),
	})
    if err !=nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
    }
}
```

Send asynchronously:

```go
var success atomic.Uint64
var failed atomic.Uint64
for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
	client.SendAsync(context.Background(),
		dataproxy.Message{
			GroupID:  "test",
			StreamID: "test",
			Payload:  []byte("test|a|b|c"),
		},
		func(msg dataproxy.Message, err error) {
			if err != nil {
				success.Add(1)
			} else {
				failed.Add(1)
			}
		})
}

// wait async send finish
time.Sleep(3 * time.Second)
fmt.Println("success:", success.Load())
fmt.Println("failed:", failed.Load())
```

The asynchronous way is recommended, as the synchronous way has no concurrency, messages can be sent after the previous one is done or timeout, it can't fulfill your requirements when you need high throughput.

### Close the SDK 
Closing the SDK can be done simply by calling the  `Close()` method of the `Client`:

```go
client.Close()
```

## Notes
- `GroupID` and `URL` are mandatory options when you initialize the SDK, you can call `dataproxy.WithGroupID()` and 
  `dataproxy.WithURL()` to set them;
-  When you initialize more the one instance of `Client`, the `MetricsName` must be set to different values, or it will be failed when pulling metrics, you can call `dataproxy.WithMetricsName()` to set it;
- The default values of the config options of the SDK are good enough for production, you don't need the change then unless you really need to do that, the default values are described in a section below;
- The `Send()` method of the SDK has no concurrent, messages are sent one by one, it is NOT recommended;
- The SDK will retry 2 times each message, if it still failed finally, it is up to you to decide what to do next.

## Errors
Some common errors:

| Error                                                       | Desc                                       |
