| Standard             | Standard Architecture, contains all InLong components such as InLong Agent, Manager, MQ, Sort, Dashboard                                                      | Support `Data Ingestion`, `Data Synchronization` and `Data Subscription` at the same time |
| Lightweight          | Lightweight Architecture, contains only one component of InLong Sort, which also can be used with Manager, Dashboard                                          | The lightweight architecture is simple and flexible, only support `Data Synchronization`  |
| Data Ingestion       | Data ingestion is the process of moving data from a source into a landing area or an object store where it can be used for ad hoc queries and analytics       |                                                                                           |
| Data Synchronization | Data synchronization is the process of establishing consistency between source and target data stores, and the continuous harmonization of the data over time |                                                                                           |
| Data Subscription    | Data Subscription provides subscribers bulk data feeds of the data they are entitled to access                                                                |                                                                                           |
| Group                | Data Streams Group, it contains multiple data streams, and one Group represents one data business unit.                                                       | Group has attributes such as ID and Name.                                                 |
| Stream               | Data Stream, a stream has a specific data source, data format and data sink.                                                                                  | Stream has attributes such as ID, Name, and data fields.                                  |
| Node                 | Data Node, including `Extract Node` and `Load Node`,  stands for the data source and sink types separately.                                                   |                                                                                           |
| InLongMsg            | InLong data format, if you consume message directly from the message queue, you need to perform `InLongMsg` parsing first.                                    |                                                                                           |
| Cluster              | Each component can form a single cluster.                                                                                                                     | Contains cluster name, label, necessary information for each component, etc.              |
| Tag                  | Clusters of different components can use the same tag to represent a set of data stream execution units.                                                      | Currently tag are only available for clusters                                             |
| Agent                | The standard architecture uses Agent for data collection, and Agent represents different types of collection capabilities.                                    | It contains File Agent, SQL Agent, Binlog Agent, etc.                                     |
| DataProxy            | Forward received data to different message queues.                                                                                                            | Supports data transmission blocking, placing retransmission.                              |
| Sort                 | Data stream sorting.                                                                                                                                          | Sort-flink based on Flink, sort-standalone for local sorting.                             |
| TubeMQ               | InLong's self-developed message queuing service                                                                                                               | It can also be called Tube, with low-cost, high-performance features.                     |
| Pulsar               | [Apache Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org/), a high-performance, high-consistency message queue service                                                       |                                                                                           |
